# Privacy Policy for AgentAPI Dify Plugin

**Last Updated:** July 12, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy outlines how the AgentAPI Dify Plugin ("the Plugin") handles your information. This Plugin is designed to act as a client, facilitating communication between your Dify instance and a self-hosted or third-party AgentAPI server.

Our core privacy principle is simple: **we do not collect, store, or process any of your personal data.**

## 2. Data Handling

### 2.1. No Data Collection

The Plugin itself does not collect or store any personal information, conversation data, or credentials. It operates as a stateless client that passes information directly to your specified AgentAPI server.

### 2.2. Data Transmission

All data exchanged through this Plugin, including but not limited to:
- API keys and other credentials entered into Dify.
- Messages and prompts you send.
- Content returned by the agent.

is transmitted directly to the AgentAPI server instance you configure. The Plugin does not log, monitor, or intercept this data.

## 3. Your Responsibilities

The privacy and security of your data are contingent upon the security measures of the AgentAPI server you connect to. You are responsible for ensuring that your AgentAPI server instance is configured securely and complies with your privacy requirements. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party server you choose to use.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
